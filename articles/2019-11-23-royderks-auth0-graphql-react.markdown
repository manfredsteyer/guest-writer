**TL;DR:** This post shows you how to query, mutate, and consume data from a GraphQL server using a React client application, which implements authentication using Auth0 to guard access to privileged data.

Web applications have rapidly increased in complexity as more technologies and tools for the web have become available. One of these technologies is React, a JavaScript library for creating Single-Page Applications (SPA) or mobile applications.

Another technology that has arisen in recent years is GraphQL, which simplifies querying and mutating data over HTTP. When used together, these technologies enable you to create future-proof web applications that can be secured using Auth0.

In this post, you'll learn how to develop a secure web application with **React and GraphQL, using Apollo**. Your application will handle authentication, and logged in users can have different authorization levels that define the actions they can take in the application.

## What You'll Build

The React application that you'll build in this tutorial will display a list of events and allow you to manage the event details. The user interface will consist of two pages: a page to list the events and a page to edit the events. The application will consume the event data from a GraphQL server that is set up to handle authentication and authorization with Auth0.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to have `node` and `npm` installed on your machine. If you don't have these installed yet, you can find the installation instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

You'll also need a live GraphQL server so that the integration of GraphQL with React can be best displayed. If you don't have one, don't worry â€” we've got you covered. 

For the first part of the tutorial, you can use this [demo GraphQL server](https://auth0-graphql-simple.herokuapp.com/playground) that we are hosting on Heroku, which is a basic server that lets you read data:

```bash
https://auth0-graphql-simple.herokuapp.com/playground
```

For the second part of the tutorial, you'll need a more complex server that supports reading and writing data and that implements authorization to restrict access to resources. For that, you'll use the [GraphQL server from the first chapter of this tutorial](https://github.com/auth0-blog/auth0-graphql-server).

To run that server, follow the steps in the _Getting started_ section of the repo's `README` file, including [adding your Auth0 information](https://auth0.com/blog/build-and-secure-a-graphql-server-with-node-js/#Securing-a-GraphQL-Server-with-Auth0). If you don't have an Auth0 account yet, you can <a href="https://auth0.com/signup" data-amp-replace="CLIENT_ID" data-amp-addparams="anonId=CLIENT_ID(cid-scope-cookie-fallback-name)">register one for free here</a>. 

> **Note** You will need to write down the values for `AUTH0_DOMAIN` and `API_IDENTIFIER` from the `.env` file of the GraphQL server, as you'll also need these values for this post.

Finally, to complete this tutorial you need to have prior knowledge about JavaScript and React and be able to create components and update their state.

## What Is GraphQL?

In short, GraphQL is a query language for APIs that lets you query and mutate data over HTTP. It was publicly released by Facebook in 2015 to help them provide their mobile applications with just the data they need instead of sending "raw" data over REST that needs to be filtered in the frontend. If you feel like you need to learn more about GraphQL, you can read a longer description in the [first part](https://github.com/auth0-blog/auth0-graphql-server) of this series about GraphQL.

## Creating a SPA with React

To quickly create a React application, you can use [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which is an integrated toolchain that provides a great developer experience. `create-react-app` creates a frontend build pipeline that you can pair with any backend you need to consume, such as a GraphQL API.  

### Getting started with React

Instead of installing `create-react-app` globally on your machine, you can use `npx` to execute the remote package locally to scaffold your React application. `npx` is a package runner tool that comes installed with  `npm v5.2+`.

Run the following command in your terminal to create a new React project:

```bash
npx create-react-app auth-graphql-app
```

Once the project is created, you'll see a new directory called `auth-graphql-app` under the directory where you executed the command. This directory holds all the boilerplate code of your React application.

To move into this directory and start the application, run the following command:

```
cd auth-graphql-app && npm start
```

The command `npm start` will execute a start script defined in `package.json`, which compiles and runs your code on a local development server. You can access your live React application by opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

One of the most important files in your project is `src/index.js`, which is the entry point of your React application. In this file, a component called `App` is rendered by `ReactDOM`. All the components that you'd like to render in the browser must be children of the `App` component, which is defined in the `src/App.js` file.
 
You can think of the `App` component as the top-level component of your application. As such, `App` is the best place to bootstrap your application's routing. React doesn't provide a routing module out of the box; however, you can use a popular and well-maintained package called `react-router-dom` to take care of your application routing needs. 
 
Install that routing package from npm by running the command below in your terminal:

```
npm install react-router-dom history
```

With `react-router-dom`, you can import a `Router` component that will be used by your application to change pages dynamically without triggering a full-page refresh. The `Router` component must be added at the top level in `src/index.js` and it must wrap the `App` component.

Update `src/index.js` as follows: 

```jsx harmony
// src/index.js

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router>
    <App />
  </Router>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Next, define the routes for your application within the `App` component by replacing the code present in the `src/App.js` file with the following:

```jsx harmony
// src/App.js

import React from "react";
import { Switch, Route } from "react-router-dom";

function App() {
  return (
    <Switch>
      <Route path="/event/:id">Event</Route>
      <Route path="*">All Events</Route>
    </Switch>
  );
}

export default App;
```

With the changes above, you've created two routes for your application: `/event/:id` and `*`. The `Switch` component first tries to find the route for a single event identified by an `:id` parameter; if that's not found, it directs to the _All Events_ route. The `*` value of the `path` attribute marks that route as a default route; it has to be the last in the route hierarchy.

The route for a single event can be found by visiting a page with the url `http://localhost:3000/event` followed by the event `id`, e.g: [`http://localhost:3000/event/123`](http://localhost:3000/event/123). Later on in this tutorial, you'll add the data to these routes.

### Cleaning up the project

You can delete the following files from the project now, as you won't need them:

```
src
|-- App.css
|-- App.test.js
|-- index.css
|-- logo.svg
|-- serviceWorker.js
|-- setupTests.js
```

You can delete all these files easily by running this command:

```bash
rm src/App.css src/App.test.js src/index.css src/logo.svg src/serviceWorker.js src/setupTests.js 
```

The project is now ready to be connected to a GraphQL server.

## Handling Environmental Variables

Your application may use configuration variables that may change depending on the environment where the application is running. As such, instead of hard coding that data in your application components, it's better to store them in a centralized location, like a local environment file.
 
When you create an application using Create React App, you can create a `.env` file under the root project directory to define environmental variables. You can access the variables within your application components by using the `process.env` object.

The variables defined within the `.env` file of a Create React App project must be prefixed with `REACT_APP_`; otherwise, you won't be able to access them, as [any other variables except `NODE_ENV` will be ignored](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/) to avoid accidentally exposing a private key on the machine that could have the same name.

From the root directory of the project, run this command to create the `.env` file:

```bash
touch .env
```

Place the following code in this file:

```
REACT_APP_APOLLO_CLIENT_URI=https://auth0-graphql-simple.herokuapp.com/graphql
```

The first configuration variable that you are defining is `REACT_APP_APOLLO_CLIENT_URI`, which represents the GraphQL endpoint that you will connect to your React app. You'll be using this variable in the next section.

Keep in mind that whenever you change any environment variables you will have to restart the development server for the application to consume the changes made to `.env`.

## Using GraphQL with Apollo

As with any other remote server, you can send requests to the GraphQL server over plain HTTP. But there are also packages that help you send requests to a GraphQL server, like [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/). With Apollo, you can connect with the GraphQL server, handle sending documents to the server, and enable caching for data retrieved from the server. Apollo  provides you with both React Components and React Hooks to send documents to the GraphQL server, capabilities that you'll set up in this section.

### Set up Apollo client with React

In the previous section you set the environmental variable `REACT_APP_APOLLO_CLIENT_URI` to be [https://auth0-graphql-simple.herokuapp.com/graphql](https://auth0-graphql-simple.herokuapp.com/graphql), which is the demo server that you'll first use to send documents to from your React application. Later in this post, this demo server will be replaced with a more complex server that can handle authentication and authorization.

Before you can send documents to the GraphQL server, you need to set up the connection with the server by adding the package `apollo-boost`. This package configures a GraphQL client for your application with Apollo's recommended settings for caching, state management, and error handling. In addition to `apollo-boost`, you need to install the packages `@apollo/react-hooks` and `graphql`. The  `@apollo/react-hooks` packages enables you to handle queries and mutations from your React components, while `graphql` is needed to use GraphQL's query language inside your application. To add these packages to your application, run the following command from your terminal:

```
npm install apollo-boost @apollo/react-hooks graphql
```

In the file `src/index.js`, you can subsequently import the method `ApolloClient` from [`apollo-boost`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/tree/master/packages/apollo-boost); `ApolloClient` will create the GraphQL client for you. This method needs the endpoint to the GraphQL server that is running on `http://localhost:4000/` to get you started. By default, the client expects the GraphQL server to be running on the `/graphql` endpoint. The client is created by making the changes below to `src/index.js`:

```jsx harmony
// src/index.js

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from "react-router-dom";
import ApolloClient from "apollo-boost";
import App from "./App";

const client = new ApolloClient({
	uri: process.env.REACT_APP_APOLLO_CLIENT_URI
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router>
    <App />
  </Router>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

But creating a client isn't sufficient. To connect your React application to the GraphQL server, you also need to create a Provider that wraps your application and makes it possible to access the client from everywhere in your project. This Provider uses the Context API from React. I [previously wrote a blog post](https://auth0.com/blog/handling-authentication-in-react-with-context-and-hooks/) on this subject, so if you aren't familiar with it, check out that post.

Create your Provider by importing `ApolloProvider` from `@apollo/react-hooks` in the file `src/index.js` and then pass the client to it. The `ApolloProvider` must be placed inside the `Router` to wrap the `App` component that is rendered by `ReactDOM`; to do this, make the following changes:

```jsx harmony
// src/index.js

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from "react-router-dom";
import ApolloClient from "apollo-boost";
import { ApolloProvider } from "@apollo/react-hooks";
import App from "./App";

const client = new ApolloClient({
	uri: process.env.REACT_APP_APOLLO_CLIENT_URI
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router>
    <ApolloProvider client={client}>
      <App />
    </ApolloProvider>
  </Router>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

You can now send documents with queries or mutations from any component that's nested within `ApolloProvider` by using `@apollo/react-hooks`. This procedure will be demonstrated in the next part of this section.

### Query the GraphQL server with Apollo

In the previous part, you wrapped the `App` component with `ApolloProvider` so that you can use the methods `useQuery` and `useMutation` from `@apollo/react-hooks` to request and mutate data from the GraphQL server. These methods use the [Hooks pattern](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-hooks/) from React and take a GraphQL document as a parameter.

To make a request and a mutation, let's first add a list of all the events to the application. Do this by sending a document with a query from a new React component to the GraphQL server using `useQuery`. In the directory `src`, create a new file called `Events.js` with the following command:

```bash
touch src/Events.js
```

The query for getting the events was described earlier in this post; add it to this file together with the `useQuery` Hook:

```jsx harmony
// src/Events.js

import React from 'react';
import { gql } from 'apollo-boost';
import { useQuery } from '@apollo/react-hooks';

const GET_EVENTS = gql`
  query getEvents {
    events {
      id
      title
      date
    }
  }
`;

function Events() {
  const { loading, data, error } = useQuery(GET_EVENTS);

  if (loading) return 'Loading...';
  if (error) return 'Something went wrong...';

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.events.map(({ id, title, date }) => (
        <li key={id}>
          {title} ({date})
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export default Events;
```

The query `getEvents` is passed to the `useQuery` Hook that returns the variable `loading` when it is called. After resolving, the Hook will return either a `data` object with the events or an `error` object. If all goes well, the `data` object contains an array with the event that you can iterate over to return a list of all events.

To see the list of events in your browser, you also need to import the `Events` component in the file `src/App.js` and have it returned by the `*` routes in your `App` component. Let's also add a header with a title to this component with some styling. Styling can be done in several ways with React. One of the easiest is to use inline style attributes that require properties to be written in camel case. Let's see how this works by adding inline styling to the `App` component:

```jsx harmony
// src/App.js

import React from "react";
import { Switch, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Events from "./Events";

function App() {
  const appStyle = { fontFamily: "Helvetica" };
  const headerStyle = {
    display: "inline-block",
    width: "100%",
    backgroundColor: "lightBlue",
    padding: "10 20px",
    textAlign: "center",
    borderRadius: "5px"
  };
  const h1Style = { color: "white" };

  return (
    <div style={appStyle}>
      <header style={headerStyle}>
        <h1 style={h1Style}>Events</h1>
      </header>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/event/:id">Event</Route>
        <Route path="*">
          <Events />
        </Route>
      </Switch>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Open the browser again, and you will see that the list of events is being displayed together with the `title` and `date` of each event. This page could also use some styling, so do this by changing the following in the file `src/Events.js`:

```jsx harmony
// src/Events.js

// ...

function Events() {
  const { loading, data, error } = useQuery(GET_EVENTS);

  const ulStyle = { listStyle: "none", width: "100%", padding: "0" };
  const liStyle = {
    backgroundColor: "lightGrey",
    marginBottom: "10px",
    padding: "10px",
    borderRadius: "5px"
  };
  const spanStyle = { fontStyle: "italic" };

  if (loading) return "Loading...";
  if (error) return "Something went wrong...";

  return (
    <ul style={ulStyle}>
      {data.events.map(({ id, title, date }) => (
        <li key={id} style={liStyle}>
          <h2>{title}</h2>
          <span style={spanStyle}>{date}</span>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export default Events;
```

So far you've learned how to set up a basic React application and use Apollo to retrieve data from a GraphQL server. Using this data you've produced a nicely formatted list of all the events returned by the server.

But having just a list of all the events is probably not sufficient: you might want to display the attendees for each event. However, this information is private and requires that you send a valid JWT along with your query. This JWT can be retrieved by sending a request to the Auth0 authentication service. You'll learn how to do this retrieval process in the next section.

## Securing a React App

To secure your React application and your GraphQL server easily, you will need to use Auth0. By sending a request to the Auth0 authentication service with your credentials, you'll retrieve a JWT that can be validated by a GraphQL server.

For this section, you'll start using a more complex server that exposes an API with protected operations to write data, along with a few query fields to get data to display in your React application. 

If you completed the previous tutorial, [_Build and Secure a GraphQL Server with Node.js_](https://auth0.com/blog/build-and-secure-a-graphql-server-with-node-js/), you can use the server you built there. Otherwise, make sure that you've followed the steps in the _Prerequisites_ section of this post.

We'll start by setting up your React application to talk to a secured server.

### Handle Authentication

In order to send a request to Auth0, you will need to use the package [`@auth0/auth0-spa-js`](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react/01-login) together with your Auth0 `Domain` and `Client ID`. To get these values, create a new Single-Page Application on the [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/) page in the Auth0 dashboard. Make sure to use the same Auth0 account as the one you used to set up the GraphQL server. To proceed, install both `@auth0/auth0-spa-js` from npm:

```
npm install @auth0/auth0-spa-js
```

After installing this package, add a new file called `src/react-auth0-spa.js` in your project by running:

```bash
touch src/react-auth0-spa.js
```

Then place the following code inside:

```jsx harmony
// src/react-auth0-spa.js

import React, { useState, useEffect, useContext } from "react";
import createAuth0Client from "@auth0/auth0-spa-js";

const DEFAULT_REDIRECT_CALLBACK = () =>
  window.history.replaceState({}, document.title, window.location.pathname);

export const Auth0Context = React.createContext();

export const useAuth0 = () => useContext(Auth0Context);

export const Auth0Provider = ({
  children,
  onRedirectCallback = DEFAULT_REDIRECT_CALLBACK,
  ...initOptions
}) => {
  const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState();
  const [user, setUser] = useState();
  const [auth0Client, setAuth0] = useState();
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [popupOpen, setPopupOpen] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const initAuth0 = async () => {
      const auth0FromHook = await createAuth0Client(initOptions);
      setAuth0(auth0FromHook);

      if (window.location.search.includes("code=")) {
        const { appState } = await auth0FromHook.handleRedirectCallback();
        onRedirectCallback(appState);
      }

      const isAuthenticated = await auth0FromHook.isAuthenticated();

      setIsAuthenticated(isAuthenticated);

      if (isAuthenticated) {
        const user = await auth0FromHook.getUser();
        setUser(user);
      }

      setLoading(false);
    };
    initAuth0();
    // eslint-disable-next-line
  }, []);

  const loginWithPopup = async (params = {}) => {
    setPopupOpen(true);
    try {
      await auth0Client.loginWithPopup(params);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    } finally {
      setPopupOpen(false);
    }
    const user = await auth0Client.getUser();
    setUser(user);
    setIsAuthenticated(true);
  };

  const handleRedirectCallback = async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    await auth0Client.handleRedirectCallback();
    const user = await auth0Client.getUser();
    setLoading(false);
    setIsAuthenticated(true);
    setUser(user);
  };

  const contextValue = {
    isAuthenticated,
    user,
    loading,
    popupOpen,
    loginWithPopup,
    handleRedirectCallback,
    getIdTokenClaims: (...p) => auth0Client.getIdTokenClaims(...p),
    loginWithRedirect: (...p) => auth0Client.loginWithRedirect(...p),
    getTokenSilently: (...p) => auth0Client.getTokenSilently(...p),
    getTokenWithPopup: (...p) => auth0Client.getTokenWithPopup(...p),
    logout: (...p) => auth0Client.logout(...p)
  };

  return (
    <Auth0Context.Provider value={contextValue}>
      {children}
    </Auth0Context.Provider>
  );
};
```

This file sets up the connection with Auth0 and returns a Provider called `Auth0Provider` and a Hook. This Provider is similar to `ApolloProvider` and needs your Auth0 credentials, making it possible to use the `useAuth0` Hook to connect with Auth0 from any components that are nested inside.

Before adding the `Auth0Provider` to your project, you must register your React application with Auth0. If you have not created an Auth0 account yet, I invite you to <a href="https://auth0.com/signup" data-amp-replace="CLIENT_ID" data-amp-addparams="anonId=CLIENT_ID(cid-scope-cookie-fallback-name)">sign up for a free Auth0 account here</a>.

Once you log into your Auth0 account, open the [Applications section of the Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) and click on the _Create Application_ button. 

In the dialog box that comes up, set the name for your application, for example _EventsQL_, and select _Single Web Page Application_ as the application type. Once that's done, click on the _Create_ button.

On the new page that loads, click on the _Settings_ tab to find the values for `Domain` and `Client ID` from Auth0 that you'll need to set up the `Auth0Provider` of your React application.

The values for `Domain` and `Client ID` must be stored  in your `.env` file as follows:

```
REACT_APP_APOLLO_CLIENT_URI=https://auth0-graphql-simple.herokuapp.com/graphql
REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN
REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
```

The values of `YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN` and `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` must be replaced by the values for `Domain` and `Client ID` from the _Settings_ tab of the Auth0 application page.

On that same tab, scroll down to find the _Allowed Callback URLs_, _Allowed Logout URLs_, and _Allowed Web Origins_ fields. Set each of these values to the address where your React application is running, which in this case is `http://localhost:3000`. Once that's done, scroll down and click on the _Save Changes_ button.

You can now restart the development server of Create React App by running `npm start` again. Your Auth0 credentials should now be available to use in the application to set up `Auth0Provider` in the file `src/index.js` and be placed around the `ApolloProvider` component. Also, `Auth0Provider` should call a callback function to redirect the user to the correct page after authentication. This function is used to clear the user's authentication code from the URL so the user will not have to re-authenticate if they move to a different page. The `history` object is used to enable the user to navigate without refreshing the page, which would delete the users' authentication code from the Context of `Auth0Provider`. This value is created with the `createBrowserHistory` function from the `history` package, which is a major dependency of `react-router-dom` and therefore does not have to be installed separately:

```jsx harmony
// src/index.js

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import ApolloClient from "apollo-boost";
import { ApolloProvider } from "@apollo/react-hooks";
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from "react-router-dom";
import { createBrowserHistory } from "history";
import App from "./App";
import { Auth0Provider } from "./react-auth0-spa";

const history = createBrowserHistory();

const client = new ApolloClient({
	uri: process.env.REACT_APP_APOLLO_CLIENT_URI
});

const onRedirectCallback = () => {
  history.push(window.location.pathname);
};

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router>
    <Auth0Provider
      domain={process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN}
      client_id={process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID}
      redirect_uri={window.location.origin}
      onRedirectCallback={onRedirectCallback}
      audience={process.env.REACT_APP_API_IDENTIFIER}
    >
      <ApolloProvider client={client}>
        <App />
      </ApolloProvider>
    </Auth0Provider>
  </Router>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Any component that is nested within `Auth0Provider` is now able to send requests to the Auth0 service to authenticate the user by using the `useAuth0` Hook. This Hook returns multiple functions to help with this process, starting with the `loginWithRedirect` method that initiates the authentication with Auth0 and redirects the user to the login page. Also, the function `logout` is used by unauthenticated users, and the const `isAuthenticated` shows the authentication status of a user. Add this functionality to the file `src/App.js` with the following code:

```jsx harmony
// src/App.js

import React from "react";
import { Switch, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Events from "./Events";
import { useAuth0 } from "./react-auth0-spa";

function App() {
  const appStyle = { fontFamily: "Helvetica" };
  const headerStyle = {
    display: "inline-block",
    width: "100%",
    backgroundColor: "lightBlue",
    padding: "10 20px",
    textAlign: "center",
    borderRadius: "5px"
  };
  const h1Style = { color: "white" };

  const { loginWithRedirect, logout, isAuthenticated } = useAuth0();

  return (
    <div style={appStyle}>
      <header style={headerStyle}>
        <h1 style={h1Style}>Events</h1>
        <button onClick={!isAuthenticated ? loginWithRedirect : logout}>
          {!isAuthenticated ? "Login" : "Logout"}
        </button>
      </header>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/event/:id">Event</Route>
        <Route path="*">
          <Events />
        </Route>
      </Switch>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

When the _Login_ button is clicked, the Auth0 login screen is opened. After logging in or creating an account, you will be asked to authorize your Auth0 application, "EventsQL", to access your Auth0 tenant. The authorization request will also show you the permissions that the Auth0 application is requesting, such as access to your profile and email information.

![Auth0 application requesting authorization to access profile information](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/developing-secure-web-applications-with-react-and-graphql/authentication-content.png)

Once you grant access or consent, you are redirected to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000/). If the authentication was successful, the _Login_ button will now change into a _Logout_ button. Clicking this button will delete the authentication details of the user from the browsers.

> Whenever you make a change to the code in this project, the Create React App development server may restart and make the browser refresh the page. If this happens, you need to re-authenticate with Auth0 by clicking the _Login_ button again.

Now that you've completed the steps in this part of the section, you are able to authenticate with Auth0â€”that is, you can start sending authenticated requests to the GraphQL server. You'll explore this functionality in the next sections.

## Setting Up a GraphQL Server

In this section, you'll use a more complex GraphQL server that supports both read and write operations and that implements an authorization layer to restrict access to resources. This server is the result of completing the tutorial called [_Build and Secure a GraphQL Server with Node.js_](https://auth0.com/blog/build-and-secure-a-graphql-server-with-node-js/). If you've completed that tutorial, you can proceed to the next subsection, _Sending authenticated requests to the GraphQL server_.

If you have not yet completed that tutorial, follow the instructions below â€” which uses the code from the tutorialâ€”to set up the server, which is hosted in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/auth0-blog/auth0-graphql-server):

- Anywhere in your system, run the following command to clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:auth0-blog/auth0-graphql-server.git
```

- Move into the directory created for the project:

```bash
cd auth0-graphql-server
```

- Follow the steps in the [Securing a GraphQL Server with Auth0](https://auth0.com/blog/build-and-secure-a-graphql-server-with-node-js/#Securing-a-GraphQL-Server-with-Auth0) section of the previous post to set up an Auth0 API for your server. An Auth0 API is an API that you define within your Auth0 tenant, which you can consume from your applications to process authentication and authorization requests.

- Create a new file called `.env` under the root project directory and add your Auth0 information to it like this:

```bash
AUTH0_DOMAIN=auth0blog.auth0.com
API_IDENTIFIER=https://graphql-api
```

The value of `AUTH0_DOMAIN` follows the pattern `<AUTH0-TENANT-NAME>.auth0.com`, where `AUTH0-TENANT-NAME` is the name of the Auth0 tenant where your Auth0 API is being hosted. This is exactly the same **Domain** value that you can find under the _Settings_ tab of your Auth0 application, _EventQL_. 

The value of `API_IDENTIFIER` is the Identifier value you created for the API. 

After creating this file and adding the correct values to it, install the project dependencies and start the GraphQL server by running this code:

```bash
npm install && npm start
```

The GraphQL server will become available at [`http://localhost:4000/graphql`](http://localhost:4000/graphql). Head back to your React application and open `.env`. Replace the value of `REACT_APP_APOLLO_CLIENT_URI` with `http://localhost:4000/graphql`.

Next, you need to add a new `REACT_APP_API_IDENTIFIER` variable to the React `.env` file. The value of `API_IDENTIFIER` must be the same value as the `API_IDENTIFIER` you created earlier to set up the Auth0 API.

Your final React `.env` file will look similar to this:

```bash
REACT_APP_APOLLO_CLIENT_URI=http://localhost:4000/graphql
REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN
REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
REACT_APP_API_IDENTIFIER=GRAPHQL_SERVER_API_IDENTIFIER
```

To test whether the Graph server is up and running, you can use the interactive playground at [`http://localhost:4000/playground`](http://localhost:4000/playground). By using this GraphQL Playground interface, you can inspect the schema of this server or send documents containing queries or mutations to it. An example of a document with a query that can be handled by this GraphQL server is:

```
query {
  events {
    title
    date
    attendants {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

The response to this query will be the full list of events, including the `title`, `date`, and `attendants` of the event. This response will be in JSON and looks like the following:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "events": [
      {
        "title": "GraphQL Introduction Night",
        "date": "2019-11-06T17:34:25+00:00",
        "attendants": null
      },
      {
        "title": "GraphQL Introduction Night #2",
        "date": "2019-11-06T17:34:25+00:00",
        "attendants": null
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

As you can see in the JSON response above, the value for the field `attendants` is `null`, as this field is protected and you need to send a valid JWT along with the document in order to view it. In the next section you'll learn how to send secure requests to this GraphQL server so that you can view protected fields.

## Making Secured Requests to the GraphQL Server

Now that you're able to authenticate, it is possible to send authenticated requests to the server. For example, you might want to query an individual event. To do this, let's create a component to display a single event first. Create a file called `Event.js` in the `src` directory by running:

```bash
touch src/Event.js
```

Add this code block to that file:

```jsx harmony
// src/Event.js

import React from "react";
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";
import { gql } from "apollo-boost";
import { useQuery } from "@apollo/react-hooks";

const GET_EVENT = gql`
  query getEvent($id: Int!) {
    event(id: $id) {
      id
      title
      date
      attendants {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
`;

function Event() {
  const { id } = useParams();

  const { loading, data, error } = useQuery(GET_EVENT, {
    variables: { id: parseInt(id) }
  });

  if (loading) return "Loading...";
  if (error) return "Something went wrong...";

  const { title, date, description, attendants, canEdit } =
    (data && data.event) || {};

  const ulStyle = {
    listStyle: "none",
    width: "100%",
    backgroundColor: "lightGrey",
    margin: "10px 0",
    padding: "10px",
    borderRadius: "5px"
  };

  return (
    <div style={ulStyle}>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <em>{date}</em>

      <p>{description}</p>

      {attendants && (
        <div>
          <strong>Attendants:</strong>

          <ul>
            {attendants.map(attendant => (
              <li key={attendant.id}>{attendant.name}</li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Event;
```

This file uses the `GET_EVENT` query to retrieve a single event based on the `id` for the route, which you can test by going to [`http://localhost:3000/event/2`](http://localhost:3000/event/2). The `useParams` Hook from `react-router-dom` gets the value for `id` from the route, and the `useQuery` Hook retrieves the event. You can see there are no attendees displayed yet, as the information on the field `attendants` is only visible when you pass a valid JWT with the query.

Passing along a JWT requires you to set more parameters to the `useQuery` Hook, but first let's make the single event route render this new `Event` component. To accomplish this, you need to import this component into the file `src/App.js` and add it to the route for `/event/:id`:

```jsx harmony
// src/App.js

import React from "react";
import { Switch, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Events from "./Events";
import Event from "./Event";

// ...

  return (
    <div style={appStyle}>
      <header style={headerStyle}>
        <h1 style={h1Style}>Events</h1>
      </header>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/event/:id"><Event /></Route>
        <Route path="*">
          <Events />
        </Route>
      </Switch>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Also, the single event route must be reachable from the `Events` component. Use the `Link` component from `react-router-dom` and add this to the file `src/Events.js`:

```jsx harmony
// src/Events.js

import React from "react";
import { gql } from "apollo-boost";
import { useQuery } from "@apollo/react-hooks";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

const GET_EVENTS = gql`
  query getEvents {
    events {
      id
      title
      date
    }
  }
`;

function Events() {
  const { loading, data, error } = useQuery(GET_EVENTS);

  const ulStyle = { listStyle: "none", width: "100%", padding: "0" };
  const liStyle = {
    backgroundColor: "lightGrey",
    marginBottom: "10px",
    padding: "10px",
    borderRadius: "5px"
  };
  const spanStyle = { fontStyle: "italic" };

  if (loading) return "Loading...";
  if (error) return "Something went wrong...";

  return (
    <ul style={ulStyle}>
      {data.events.map(({ id, title, date }) => (
        <Link key={id} to={`/event/${id}`}>
          <li style={liStyle}>
            <h2>{title}</h2>
            <span style={spanStyle}>{date}</span>
          </li>
        </Link>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export default Events;
```

In the file `src/Event.js`, the `useQuery` Hook must be altered so it can take a `context` object containing the header information as a parameter. This header information should include the field `authorization` that contains the JWT, which can be retrieved with the `getTokenSilently` method from the `useAuth0` Hook. As this is an asynchronous function, you will need to call it from a React `useEffect` Hook and store the value in the local state using `useState`. You can do this by making the following changes to `src/Event.js`:

```jsx harmony
// src/Event.js

import React from "react";
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";
import { gql } from "apollo-boost";
import { useQuery } from "@apollo/react-hooks";
import { useAuth0 } from "./react-auth0-spa";

const GET_EVENT = gql`
  query getEvent($id: Int!) {
    event(id: $id) {
      id
      title
      date
      attendants {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
`;

function Event() {
  const { id } = useParams();

  const { isAuthenticated, getTokenSilently } = useAuth0();
  const [bearerToken, setBearerToken] = React.useState("");

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const getToken = async () => {
      const token = isAuthenticated ? await getTokenSilently() : "";

      setBearerToken(`Bearer ${token}`);
    };
    getToken();
  }, [getTokenSilently, isAuthenticated]);

  const { loading, data, error } = useQuery(GET_EVENT, {
    variables: { id: parseInt(id), bearerToken },
    context: {
      headers: {
        authorization: bearerToken
      }
    }
  });

  if (loading) return "Loading...";
  if (error) return "Something went wrong...";

  const { title, date, description, attendants, canEdit } =
  (data && data.event) || {};

  const ulStyle = {
    listStyle: "none",
    width: "100%",
    backgroundColor: "lightGrey",
    margin: "10px 0",
    padding: "10px",
    borderRadius: "5px"
  };

  return (
    <div style={ulStyle}>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <em>{date}</em>

      <p>{description}</p>

      {attendants && (
        <div>
          <strong>Attendants:</strong>

          <ul>
            {attendants.map(attendant => (
              <li key={attendant.id}>{attendant.name}</li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Event;
```

After the asynchronous call has been added to the `getTokenSilently` function using the code above, the token information for this user becomes available. When you're authenticated and visit a page with a single event, the token from Auth0 will be sent along with the document containing the query to retrieve this event. If your token is valid, the response of the GraphQL server will also include a list with all the attendees of the event.

> **Note** If you don't see a list of attendees of an event, make sure that the values for `AUTH0_DOMAIN` and `API_IDENTIFIER` are the same for both the GraphQL server and the application that you're building in this post.

In addition to showing events, you also want users to be able to modify events. To do this, you need to send a document with a mutation instead of a query to the GraphQL server, together with a valid JWT. Sending documents with mutations to the GraphQL server is very similar to sending documents with queries, as you did in the first section of this post. Instead of the `useQuery` Hook, you'll use the Hook called `useMutation`, which enables you to send the document containing a mutation that allows you to edit events. In the previous post explaining how to create a GraphQL server, you added a mutation to edit both the `title` and `description` of an event. This mutation should also be used to edit the event from the React application.

But before creating the logic to mutate the data of an event, you will need to create a `Form` component, by running:

```bash
touch src/Form.js
```

This creates the file `src/Form.js`, to which the following code block must be added:

```jsx harmony
// src/Form.js

import React from "react";

const Form = ({ id, onSubmit, refetch, ...props }) => {
  const [title, setTitle] = React.useState(props.title);
  const [description, setDescription] = React.useState(props.description);

  const handleOnSubmit = e => {
    e.preventDefault();

    onSubmit({ variables: { id: parseInt(id), title, description } });
    refetch();
  };

  const containerStyle = {
    backgroundColor: "lightGrey",
    margin: "15px 0px",
    padding: "10px",
    borderRadius: "5px"
  };

  const labelStyle = { marginRight: "10px" };

  return (
    <div style={containerStyle}>
      <h3>Edit event</h3>
      <form onSubmit={handleOnSubmit}>
        <p>
          <label htmlFor="title" style={labelStyle}>
            Title:
          </label>
          <input
            id="title"
            type="text"
            value={title}
            onChange={e => setTitle(e.target.value)}
          />
        </p>

        <p>
          <label htmlFor="description" style={labelStyle}>
            Description:
          </label>
          <input
            id="description"
            type="text"
            value={description}
            onChange={e => setDescription(e.target.value)}
          />
        </p>

        <button>Submit</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Form;
```

This form has controlled input components that use the local state to store changes when you type in the `input` elements. When you submit the form, the `handleOnSubmit` function will be called; this function calls both the `onSubmit` and `refetch` functions that were passed as props from the `Event` component. The `onSubmit` function will send the document with the mutation to the GraphQL server, while the `refetch` function sends the document with the query to retrieve the event to the server. 

In the `Event` component, you must import the `Form` component and add the logic to send the document with the mutation. Therefore, you need to define the mutation to edit the event and use it as a parameter in the `useMutation` Hook. The `refetch` function must be destructured from the `useQuery` Hook and passed to the `Form` component, together with the `editEvent` function. To do this, make these changes to `src/Event.js`:

```js
// src/Event.js

import React from "react";
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";
import { gql } from "apollo-boost";
import { useQuery, useMutation } from "@apollo/react-hooks";
import { useAuth0 } from "./react-auth0-spa";
import Form from "./Form";

const GET_EVENT = gql`
  query getEvent($id: Int!) {
    event(id: $id) {
      id
      title
      date
      attendants {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
`;

const EDIT_EVENT = gql`
  mutation editEvent($id: Int!, $title: String!, $description: String!) {
    editEvent(id: $id, title: $title, description: $description) {
      title
      description
    }
  }
`;

function Event() {
  const { id } = useParams();

  const { isAuthenticated, getTokenSilently } = useAuth0();
  const [bearerToken, setBearerToken] = React.useState("");

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const getToken = async () => {
      const token = isAuthenticated ? await getTokenSilently() : "";

      setBearerToken(`Bearer ${token}`);
    };
    getToken();
  }, [getTokenSilently, isAuthenticated]);

  const { loading, data, error, refetch } = useQuery(GET_EVENT, {
    variables: { id: parseInt(id), bearerToken },
    context: {
      headers: {
        authorization: bearerToken
      }
    }
  });

  const [editEvent] = useMutation(EDIT_EVENT, {
    context: {
      headers: {
        authorization: bearerToken
      }
    }
  });

  if (loading) return "Loading...";
  if (error) return "Something went wrong...";

  const { title, date, description, attendants, canEdit } =
    (data && data.event) || {};

  const ulStyle = {
    listStyle: "none",
    width: "100%",
    backgroundColor: "lightGrey",
    margin: "10px 0",
    padding: "10px",
    borderRadius: "5px"
  };

  return (
    <div style={ulStyle}>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <em>{date}</em>

      <p>{description}</p>

      {attendants && (
        <div>
          <strong>Attendants:</strong>

          <ul>
            {attendants.map(attendant => (
              <li key={attendant.id}>{attendant.name}</li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        </div>
      )}

      {isAuthenticated && (
        <Form
          id={id}
          onSubmit={editEvent}
          refetch={refetch}
          title={title}
          description={description}
        />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Event;
```

After you have made these changes, you can start editing the event when you're logged in, as the `Form` component is only displayed when the user is authenticated. However, you don't want every authenticated user to be able to change the information of an event. For this reason you will also want to implement authorization. The method for accomplishing this is detailed in the next part of this section.

## Handling Authorization

Besides authentication, another important part of your application is authorization, as you want to distinguish between "regular" users and users who can modify your events. To do this, you will use permissions and user roles, which are part of the Auth0 authentication service, and can be added to the GraphQL server that you're using together with the React application that you're building in this post.

To handle authorization, you first need to perform several actions in the Auth0 Dashboard:

- Add [permissions](https://auth0.com/docs/dashboard/guides/apis/add-permissions-apis) to the API that you've created in the GraphQL Server tutorial. Do this by going to the [API](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis/) page in the Auth0 dashboard and opening the Auth0 API you created for your GraphQL server. On this page, create a new permission called `edit:events` in the _Permissions_ tab. Add "Edit events" as the description.

- On this same page, make sure that both checkboxes for _RBAC Settings_ on the _Settings_ tab are checked. The first enables Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for the GraphQL server, and the second adds permissions for the user to the JWT. Scroll down and click on _Save_.

- Add this permission to a [user role](https://auth0.com/docs/dashboard/guides/roles/add-permissions-roles) and add a user to this role. A new user role can also be added by visiting the [Roles](https://manage.auth0.com/#/roles/) page. Here you must create a new role called `admin` using the _Create role_ button. After creating the role, you must add the `edit:events` permission and a user to it.

- Add a `permission` and a user to this role by clicking on the newly created role on the [Roles](https://manage.auth0.com/#/roles/) page. On the page that opens, you can add the `edit:events` permission to this role from the _Permissions_ tab and the user from the _Users_ tab, which must be the user you're using to log in to the application you've created in this post.

These changes make it possible to give users permission to edit events and add these permissions to the JWT that is created for a given user. The validation of the JWT takes place on the GraphQL server, so the logic to check that a user has the correct permission to edit an event must be added to the GraphQL server as well. To do so, find the file `src/index.js` in the code for the GraphQL server and make the following changes:

```js
// src/index.js

...

// Provide resolver functions for your schema fields
const resolvers = {

  ...

  event: async ({ id }, context) => {
    const { db, token } = await context();

    const { error, decoded } = await isTokenValid(token);

    const event = await db.collection('events').findOne({ id });

    const canEdit = decoded
      ? decoded.permissions && decoded.permissions.includes('edit:events')
      : false;

    return { ...event, attendants: !error ? event.attendants : null, canEdit };
  },

  ...

```

The `isTokenValid` function decodes the JWT; inside the decoded JWT, the field `permissions` can be found. This field contains an array with permissions for this user, and indicates whether the permission `edit:events` that you've created before is present. If the user's JWT has this permission, it means that the user can edit the event, and the value for `canEdit` that is returned by the `event` query is true. Now that this query returns the field `canEdit`, you must also add this field to the schema for this query in `src/schema.js`:

```js
// src/schema.js

...

// Construct a schema, using GraphQL schema language
const schema = buildSchema(`
    type Event {
        id: ID!
        title: String!
        description: String
        date: String
        attendants: [Person!]
        canEdit: Boolean
    }

    ...

```

> **Note** The updated code for the GraphQL server can also be found in [this](https://github.com/auth0-blog/auth0-graphql-server) repository on Github, where must check out the `permissions` branch.

In the React application, you must update the query used to retrieve a single event, by adding the field `canEdit` here as well. When the field `canEdit` is true, the user is both authenticated and has the correct permissions to edit events. Therefore you can make changes to `src/Event.js` to not only ask for the field `canEdit`, but also to use this value to determine whether or not the `Form` component must be displayed:

```js
// src/Event.js

...

const GET_EVENT = gql`
  query getEvent($id: Int!) {
    event(id: $id) {
      id
      title
      date
      description
      attendants {
        id
        name
      }
      canEdit
    }
  }
`;

...

function Event() {

  ...

  const { title, date, description, attendants, canEdit } =
    (data && data.event) || {};

  return (
    <>

      ...

      {canEdit && (
        <Form
          id={id}
          onSubmit={editEvent}
          refetch={refetch}
          title={title}
          description={description}
        />
      )}
    </>
  );
}

export default Event;
```

If a user is authenticated but doesn't have the correct permission to edit events, the `Form` component will not be displayed, making it impossible for the user to edit event details.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've created a React application that uses a GraphQL server to retrieve its data and uses Auth0 for authorization and authentication. You've learned how to set up a basic React application with routing, and used Apollo to fetch data from a GraphQL server using queries and mutations. Through the use of Auth0, authentication and authorization are added to the application, giving users different permissions for taking actions. The full code for this tutorial can be found on Github, as well as the previous tutorial in this series, which covers how to create a GraphQL server.
